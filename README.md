# Mental Health and Lifestyle Habits (2019–2024): Exploratory Analysis

## Project Description
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the "Mental Health and Lifestyle Habits (2019–2024)" dataset from Kaggle. The analysis aims to summarize the distribution of key variables, explore preliminary associations between lifestyle factors (e.g., sleep, exercise) and mental health outcomes (e.g., stress, anxiety), and establish a reproducible workflow for subsequent regression and predictive modeling.

## Repository Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the raw dataset used for analysis (`Mental_Health_Lifestyle_Dataset.csv`).
- **`doc/`**: Contains the source R Markdown file for the final report (`final_report.Rmd`).
- **`src/`**: Contains modular R scripts responsible for data processing and generating core outputs.
- **`output/`**: Location for the compiled final report (`final_report.pdf`).
- **`Makefile`**: Automates the report generation process.

## Code for Required Outputs

- **Table:** Generated by `src/02_create_table.R`.  
  This script summarizes descriptive statistics of key lifestyle and mental health variables.  
- **Figure:** Generated by `src/03_create_figure.R`.  
  This script produces visualizations (e.g., distributions, correlations) used in the final report.

## How to Generate the Final Report (Reproducible Workflow)

To fully reproduce the analysis and compile the final report, please follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites and Setup

* **R and R Packages:** Ensure you have R installed, along with the necessary packages used in the analysis. These include: `tidyverse`, `knitr`, and `rmarkdown`.
* **Data Placement:** The required dataset, `Mental_Health_Lifestyle_Dataset.csv`, must be placed in the **`data/`** directory.

### 2. Compilation using Makefile

The final report is compiled using the `Makefile` in the root directory. This automated process ensures that the R Markdown file (`doc/final_report.Rmd`) runs all dependent R scripts in the correct order.

Open your terminal or command prompt (e.g., Git Bash, Command Prompt, or WSL), navigate to the project's root directory (`/d/550Final`), and execute the following command:

```bash
make
